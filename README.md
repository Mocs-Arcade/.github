# The Mocs Arcade Project

Note: Project in-development. Not ready for use. 

This project is ran and maintained by CompUTC at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. Our goal is to create an Arcade Machine interface that allows students to create games and easily add them to the machine for others to enjoy. Currently, the Mocs Arcade is located on the second floor of the EMCS building outside the Tutoring Center.  

If you want more information, join us on the [CompUTC Discord](https://discord.gg/CcbAhtdAtn) or through our club email: computc.utc.edu.
